					<h1>The Enterprise Guide to Going Passwordless</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="article-body">

					<h4>Foreword</h4>
					<br>
					<p>This guide is shaped by my experience designing, building, deploying, and supporting passwordless initiatives across a wide range of organizations. Over the years, I’ve worked on thousands of deployments, spanning small, technology-first teams to large global enterprises with heterogeneous environments built on decades of accumulated technology decisions.</p>
					<p>In that time, I’ve seen passwordless initiatives succeed, stall, and quietly fail. I’ve seen organizations underestimate the complexity of their identity environments, overestimate what a single technology can solve, and struggle with operational realities that only become visible during and after deployment. I’ve also seen what works: what scales, what meaningfully reduces risk, and what holds up against real users, real applications, and real attackers.</p>
					<p>This is not a vendor comparison, a technology deep dive, or a marketing perspective. It is a practitioner’s guide to how passwordless initiatives actually take shape in the real world, why some succeed, why others stall, and where many fail outright. The focus is on architecture, trade-offs, and operational patterns rather than idealized end states.</p>
					<p>The goal of this guide is to help organizations approach passwordless in a way that is practical, durable, and grounded in real-world experience.</p>

					<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
					<p>Organizations pursue passwordless authentication because compromised credentials remain the most common initial access vector for successful attacks. Industry reporting has shown this pattern consistently for years, and it continues to hold true across organizations of all sizes.</p>
					<p>Modern authentication technologies make it possible to remove passwords from many authentication flows while improving usability. The technology exists, and the problem is well understood.</p>
					<p>The challenge lies in the environment. Enterprises operate across hundreds of applications, thousands of devices, and deeply embedded legacy and infrastructure systems. Credentials continue to exist in many forms, and attackers exploit the weakest access paths rather than the most modern ones.</p>
					<p>In an enterprise context, passwordless does not mean eliminating credentials entirely. It means reducing everyday credential exposure by removing human-managed passwords from routine access. Machine credentials, infrastructure access, and service identities represent a different class of risk and require different controls.</p>
					<p>Successful passwordless programs start by understanding where authentication actually happens, centralizing authentication decisions, addressing systems that cannot support modern standards, and focusing defensive effort on high-value targets. Progress should be measured by reduced credential exposure and increased attacker friction, not by the absolute number of passwords eliminated.</p>

					<h2>Why Organizations Go Passwordless</h2>
					<p class="article-kicker"><em>(and Why It’s Harder Than It Looks)</em></p>
					<p>It is well understood why organizations prioritize passwordless initiatives. For nearly two decades, industry breach analysis has shown that weak, stolen, or compromised credentials are among the most common attack vectors responsible for large and damaging incidents. Phishing, credential reuse, password spraying, and malware-based credential harvesting continue to work because traditional passwords are reusable, easy to exfiltrate, and difficult for humans to manage securely at scale.</p>
					<p>From that perspective, removing passwords from authentication flows appears to be an obvious solution. Modern authentication standards make this practical. At a high level, these approaches replace passwords with strong cryptographic mechanisms combined with local user verification, often using device-based authentication such as biometrics. This is one of the rare cases where improving security aligns naturally with better usability.</p>
					<p>The challenge, however, is not a lack of understanding of the problem, nor the availability of a solution. The challenge is the environment.</p>
					<p>Enterprise environments are rarely clean or homogeneous. They reflect years, and often decades, of accumulated technology decisions. Identity is embedded across SaaS platforms, custom applications, legacy systems, infrastructure, third-party services, and operational access paths. Many of these systems were never designed to support modern authentication standards, let alone passwordless ones.</p>
					<p>What makes this especially difficult is that these systems are central to how the business operates. Authentication changes directly affect how employees access tools, how workflows execute, and how operations continue. Poorly coordinated changes can fragment user experiences, introduce outages, and create operational friction that directly impacts productivity.</p>
					<p>As a result, organizations often discover that going passwordless is not a matter of replacing a login screen. It requires rethinking how authentication is brokered, where credentials still exist, and how access is granted across a fragmented and interdependent environment. Initiatives fail not because the goal is wrong, but because the complexity and operational impact of change are underestimated.</p>

					<h2>What Passwordless Really Means in an Enterprise</h2>
					<p>In enterprise contexts, passwordless does not mean the absence of credentials. It means reducing exposure by removing the routine use of human-managed passwords from everyday authentication workflows.</p>
					<p>This distinction is important. Even in mature environments, credentials continue to exist in many forms. Directory objects may still have passwords. Infrastructure relies on keys, certificates, and tokens. Applications and services authenticate using API keys, OAuth credentials, and shared secrets. These mechanisms do not disappear simply because users no longer type passwords into login prompts.</p>
					<p>When organizations talk about going passwordless, they are almost always referring to end-user authentication. The objective is to eliminate the need for users to know, manage, or enter reusable secrets as part of routine access. This materially reduces exposure because humans are consistently the weakest link in credential handling. Password reuse, phishing susceptibility, and poor secret hygiene are structural problems, not training failures.</p>
					<p>Passwordless authentication also extends beyond web login experiences. Smart cards, certificates, and device-based authentication have long been used in enterprise environments to reduce reliance on passwords. Modern approaches build on these concepts by making strong cryptographic authentication easier to deploy, easier to recover from, and more consistent across platforms.</p>
					<p>It is neither realistic nor necessary to eliminate every credential to achieve meaningful security gains. What matters is removing human-handled passwords from high-frequency access paths and placing stronger controls around credentials that must still exist elsewhere.</p>

					<h2>The Real Problem Is Credential Exposure, Not Passwords</h2>
					<p>Passwords are often framed as the root of the problem. In practice, the issue is broader. Attackers do not succeed simply because passwords exist. They succeed because reusable credentials are exposed, stolen, and replayed.</p>
					<p>Many passwordless initiatives fall short because they focus exclusively on the login experience while leaving other credential pathways untouched. It is common to see organizations deploy passwordless authentication for workforce login while continuing to rely on static secrets for administrative access, automation, legacy applications, and infrastructure. From an attacker’s perspective, these environments remain highly exploitable.</p>
					<p>The weakness is not the credential itself. It is the combination of a reusable secret and a human operator. Humans are poor at protecting secrets at scale, especially when those secrets are long-lived and valid across multiple systems. Attackers exploit this mismatch relentlessly.</p>
					<p>A more effective approach treats credentials as sensitive artifacts rather than identity factors. The objective is to reduce where credentials exist, limit their lifetime, restrict how they can be accessed, and ensure that access to them is gated by strong, passwordless authentication wherever possible.</p>

					<h2>Why Enterprise Passwordless Deployments Fail</h2>
					<p>Most enterprise passwordless initiatives do not fail because the technology is inadequate. They fail because the problem is approached too narrowly.</p>
					<p>Common failure modes include treating passwordless as a single product decision, focusing on authentication factors rather than authentication architecture, and underestimating the scope of systems involved. Many initiatives stop at workforce login and never extend protections to legacy applications, operational access paths, or infrastructure.</p>
					<p>Others fail operationally. Enrollment and recovery flows are often treated as secondary concerns, even though they are frequently the paths attackers exploit to bypass strong authentication. When recovery processes are fragile, overly permissive, or poorly governed, organizations quietly reintroduce shared secrets and static credentials to keep systems running.</p>
					<p>Ownership is another frequent issue. Passwordless initiatives often span security, identity, IT operations, application teams, and infrastructure. Without clear accountability and sequencing, progress stalls and inconsistencies accumulate.</p>
					<p>Understanding these failure modes is critical, because they shape how passwordless must be approached in practice.</p>

					<h3>1. Start With Reality: Understand What You Have</h3>
					<p>A successful passwordless initiative begins with an honest assessment of the environment. This requires more than a traditional application inventory created for licensing or asset management purposes. Organizations need to understand where authentication actually happens, how users and systems authenticate today, and where credentials exist across the environment.</p>
					<p>In most enterprises, this includes hundreds of applications, thousands of devices, and an even larger number of infrastructure and operational resources. Authentication is rarely centralized or consistent. Users may authenticate differently depending on the application, access path, or device, often without realizing it. Each of these represents a potential credential exposure point.</p>
					<p>This assessment must go beyond listing systems. Applications and resources should be evaluated across several dimensions, including their ability to integrate with centralized identity systems, the sensitivity of the access they provide, the populations that rely on them, and the types of credentials they use today. This process often reveals that a relatively small number of systems account for the majority of everyday credential exposure, while a long tail of applications introduces complexity disproportionate to their value.</p>
					<p>Rationalization is not about achieving perfect coverage. It is about sequencing. Without a clear understanding of what exists and how it is used, organizations tend to treat all systems as equally important. This leads to stalled initiatives, inconsistent experiences, and over-engineering early in the process.</p>
					<div class="callout callout--principle">
						<div class="callout-title">Design Principle</div>
						<p>You cannot design passwordless without understanding what exists and how users actually access it.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>2. Centralize Human Authentication Using an Identity Provider</h3>
					<p>Centralizing authentication through an identity provider is foundational to any scalable passwordless strategy. Identity providers allow organizations to enforce consistent authentication policies, introduce phishing-resistant authentication mechanisms, and gain visibility into how users access resources.</p>
					<p>However, identity providers are often misunderstood. They are not universal adapters, and they do not eliminate the need for credentials elsewhere in the environment. They protect only the systems that can integrate with them and only the authentication flows they are placed in front of.</p>
					<p>A more effective mental model is to treat the identity provider as the control plane for human authentication. It defines how users prove their identity, under what conditions access is granted, and which authentication mechanisms are acceptable. Downstream systems may consume these assertions in different ways, but the decision-making authority remains centralized.</p>
					<p>Recognizing this distinction early prevents unrealistic expectations. Treating the identity provider as a complete solution often leads to frustration when legacy systems, infrastructure access paths, or non-human identities fall outside its direct control. Treating it as a control plane enables more realistic architecture and clearer decisions about where additional components are required.</p>
					<div class="callout callout--note">
						<div class="callout-title">Practitioner Note</div>
						<p>Identity providers help consolidate identities and authentication across most resources in the enterprise.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>3. Rationalize and Sequence Applications by Risk and Impact</h3>
					<p>Once authentication is centralized, the next challenge is deciding where to apply passwordless controls first. Not all applications contribute equally to credential exposure, and treating them as such often leads to stalled or over-scoped initiatives.</p>
					<p>In most organizations, a relatively small number of applications account for the majority of daily user authentication events. These systems are accessed frequently, by large populations, and often from unmanaged or semi-managed devices. They represent the highest volume of credential exposure and therefore the highest opportunity for risk reduction.</p>
					<p>Rationalization requires categorizing applications based on factors such as usage frequency, access sensitivity, user population, and integration capability. This process allows organizations to identify high-impact candidates for early passwordless adoption while deferring lower-risk or lower-value systems until later phases.</p>
					<p>Sequencing is critical. Attempting to modernize authentication across all applications simultaneously introduces unnecessary complexity and operational risk. By prioritizing high-impact systems first, organizations can reduce exposure quickly, validate user experience assumptions, and build confidence before expanding scope.</p>
					<p>This approach also creates political and operational leverage. Early success with visible, widely used applications makes it easier to justify the additional effort required to address more complex or less cooperative systems later.</p>
					<div class="callout callout--principle">
						<div class="callout-title">Design Principle</div>
						<p>Not all applications are equal. Sequence passwordless adoption based on risk, usage, and impact.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>4. Address Applications That Do Not Support Federation</h3>
					<p>Applications that do not support modern authentication standards are where many passwordless initiatives slow down or stall. These systems are common, varied, and often business-critical. Ignoring them undermines the effectiveness of any passwordless strategy, but attempting to modernize them all at once is rarely practical.</p>
					<p>There are three general approaches organizations take to address these systems.</p>
					<p>The first is modernization. Where possible, updating or replacing applications to support centralized authentication is the cleanest long-term solution. This approach reduces architectural complexity and allows applications to inherit passwordless policies directly. In practice, however, modernization is often constrained by vendor roadmaps, internal development capacity, or business risk.</p>
					<p>The second approach is authentication orchestration. In this model, users authenticate using passwordless methods at a centralized entry point, and an intermediary layer translates that authentication into whatever mechanism the application requires. This allows organizations to enforce strong authentication without modifying the application itself, at the cost of additional infrastructure and operational complexity.</p>
					<p>The third approach is credential abstraction. When neither modernization nor orchestration is feasible, credentials can be vaulted, rotated, and accessed only through controlled workflows. Users never see the credential and must authenticate using passwordless methods to gain access. While this does not eliminate passwords entirely, it removes them from the user experience and significantly reduces their exposure.</p>
					<p>In practice, most enterprises use a combination of all three approaches. The key is to treat them as intentional architectural patterns rather than temporary workarounds.</p>
					<div class="callout callout--principle">
						<div class="callout-title">Design Principle</div>
						<p>Applications do not always require modernization; multiple architectural options exist for modernizing authentication.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>5. Reduce Routine Human Credential Handling First</h3>
					<p>A common mistake in passwordless initiatives is treating all credentials as equally important. In reality, the greatest risk reduction comes from eliminating the credentials that humans handle most frequently.</p>
					<p>Passwords entered daily to access applications, devices, and operational tools are highly visible and easily compromised. They are exposed to phishing, keylogging, reuse, and social engineering. Reducing or eliminating these interactions materially changes the attacker’s cost and likelihood of success.</p>
					<p>By contrast, credentials used for infrastructure access, automation, or service-to-service communication are often less frequently accessed and more tightly controlled. While they represent significant risk due to their privilege level, they are better addressed through brokering, vaulting, and policy enforcement rather than direct elimination.</p>
					<p>Effective passwordless strategies therefore focus first on removing passwords from routine human workflows. This includes workforce access to applications, remote access paths, and day-to-day operational tools. Doing so reduces the largest source of credential exposure while creating a foundation for addressing higher-risk but lower-frequency access paths later.</p>
					<div class="callout callout--note">
						<div class="callout-title">Practitioner Note</div>
						<p>The fastest risk reduction comes from eliminating the credentials humans use every day.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>6. Infrastructure, Privileged Access, and High-Value Targets</h3>
					<p>Infrastructure and privileged access represent a different class of risk than workforce authentication. While fewer people interact with these systems, the impact of compromise is significantly higher. Administrative access often provides broad visibility, persistence, and the ability to disable security controls entirely.</p>
					<p>A realistic passwordless strategy does not attempt to eliminate credentials from infrastructure outright. Instead, it focuses on brokering access through systems that enforce strong authentication at the point of entry, constrain session scope and duration, and provide auditability. Credentials may still exist behind the scenes, but they are no longer directly handled by users or exposed unnecessarily.</p>
					<p>This approach aligns closely with attacker behavior. Once initial access is obtained, attackers rarely target hardened user login flows. Instead, they move laterally in search of credentials that grant elevated privileges and unrestricted access. By concentrating defensive effort on these high-value access paths, organizations can significantly reduce blast radius even when some credentials must remain in use.</p>
					<p>The key is intentionality. Infrastructure access should be rare, deliberate, time-bound, and gated by strong authentication and authorization controls. Passwordless principles apply here not by eliminating credentials, but by reducing their exposure and tightening the conditions under which they can be used.</p>
					<div class="callout callout--principle">
						<div class="callout-title">Design Principle</div>
						<p>High-value access paths should be rare, deliberate, and strongly controlled.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>7. Enrollment, Recovery, and Device Trust Are Security Controls</h3>
					<p>Strong authentication mechanisms are only as effective as the processes that surround them. Enrollment, account recovery, and device trust are often treated as operational details, but in practice they are critical security controls.</p>
					<p>Many real-world breaches do not occur because attackers defeat authentication mechanisms directly. They occur because attackers exploit weak enrollment or recovery processes to assume another user’s identity. As authentication becomes stronger, these pathways increasingly become the target.</p>
					<p>Enrollment must balance security with scalability. Recovery processes must be resilient under real-world conditions, including lost devices, hardware failures, employee transitions, and emergency access scenarios. When these processes are fragile, overly permissive, or poorly governed, organizations quietly reintroduce shared secrets or static credentials to maintain access.</p>
					<p>Device trust introduces additional complexity. Passwordless authentication often assumes a trusted device, but enterprise environments include a wide range of device types, operating systems, and access contexts. Policies that are too strict create friction and exceptions; policies that are too loose undermine the value of device-based authentication. These controls must be designed deliberately and revisited over time.</p>
					<p>Ignoring these factors does not just slow adoption. It creates bypass paths that attackers can exploit to circumvent otherwise strong authentication architectures.</p>
					<div class="callout callout--note">
						<div class="callout-title">Practitioner Note</div>
						<p>Strong authentication is routinely bypassed through weak enrollment and recovery paths.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>8. Adopt a Phased Rollout Model</h3>
					<p>Given the scope and complexity involved, passwordless adoption should be approached as a phased program rather than a single deployment. Attempting comprehensive coverage from the outset often leads to stalled initiatives, inconsistent experiences, and increased operational risk.</p>
					<p>Early phases typically focus on high-impact, user-facing access paths where credential exposure is greatest. These phases allow organizations to validate assumptions, refine enrollment and recovery processes, and measure real-world impact without disrupting critical operations.</p>
					<p>Subsequent phases address systems that require additional controls, such as non-federated applications and infrastructure access. Progress in these phases is less about speed and more about consistency, ensuring that authentication behavior remains predictable even when underlying systems differ.</p>
					<p>Phasing also creates space for learning. Authentication changes affect productivity, support processes, and operational workflows. A deliberate rollout allows organizations to adapt based on feedback, correct mistakes early, and build confidence before expanding scope.</p>
					<p>Importantly, progress should be measured by reduced credential exposure and increased attacker friction, not by the absolute number of passwords removed.</p>
					<div class="callout callout--principle">
						<div class="callout-title">Design Principle</div>
						<p>Smaller, well-defined phases that reduce risk are better than ambitious plans that never leave design.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>9. Design for the Inevitable: Credentials Will Still Exist</h3>
					<p>Even the most mature passwordless environments retain credentials. User accounts are created with credentials, legacy systems continue to rely on shared secrets, infrastructure and automation depend on keys and tokens, and emergency access scenarios require fallback mechanisms.</p>
					<p>Designing for passwordless does not mean ignoring this reality. It means planning for it explicitly. Credentials that must exist should be tightly controlled, short-lived where possible, and shielded from routine human interaction. Access to them should be gated by strong authentication, limited by policy, and monitored continuously.</p>
					<p>Problems arise when credentials persist unintentionally. Static passwords created for convenience become permanent. Recovery mechanisms are reused as operational shortcuts. Temporary exceptions become long-term dependencies. Over time, these decisions quietly reintroduce the very exposure passwordless initiatives were meant to reduce.</p>
					<p>A durable passwordless strategy anticipates these pressures and designs controls accordingly. Credential rotation, access brokering, time-bound access, and clear ownership help ensure that unavoidable credentials do not become ungoverned risk.</p>
					<div class="callout callout--principle">
						<div class="callout-title">Design Principle</div>
						<p>Stable passwordless adoption requires designing for tightly controlled access paths that will still use credentials.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>10. What Success Actually Looks Like</h3>
					<p>Truly credential-free environments are rare and unnecessary. Success is not defined by eliminating every password, key, or token. It is defined by materially reducing credential exposure and increasing the effort required for attackers to succeed.</p>
					<p>In successful passwordless programs, users rarely handle reusable secrets. Authentication flows are consistent, predictable, and resistant to phishing. High-risk access paths are gated by strong authentication and contextual controls. Credentials that must exist are constrained, monitored, and difficult to misuse.</p>
					<p>Equally important, success is operational. Enrollment and recovery processes work under real conditions. Exceptions are intentional and documented. Ownership is clear. Passwordless is treated as an operating model rather than a one-time deployment.</p>
					<p>Organizations that achieve this state may still have credentials, but those credentials no longer dominate the attack surface. Attackers encounter friction early, visibility improves, and blast radius is reduced when incidents occur.</p>
					<p><strong>Practitioner note:</strong> Success is not measured by eliminating every credential, but by reducing the attack surface they expose.</p>

					<h2>Closing</h2>
					<p>Passwordless is often framed as a binary outcome: either an organization is passwordless, or it is not. This framing is misleading and unhelpful.</p>
					<p>In practice, passwordless is a discipline. It is a way of designing identity systems that prioritizes reducing everyday credential exposure, centralizing authentication decisions, and constraining the credentials that must remain. It requires understanding the environment, sequencing change carefully, and accepting that some trade-offs are unavoidable.</p>
					<p>Focusing on metrics such as “percentage of passwords eliminated” misses the point. The credentials that matter most are the ones used frequently, broadly, and by humans in the course of daily work. Reducing those exposures delivers the greatest risk reduction. Infrastructure and privileged credentials demand equal care, but through different controls.</p>
					<p>The framework outlined in this guide is not a checklist to complete. It is a methodology to apply. Organizations will enter at different points, move at different speeds, and make different trade-offs. What matters is approaching passwordless deliberately, with clear intent and realistic expectations.</p>
					<p>Done well, passwordless does not eliminate risk. It changes its shape. And that shift is often enough to make the difference.</p>
