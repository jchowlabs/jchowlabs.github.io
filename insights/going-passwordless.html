					<h1>The Enterprise Guide to Going Passwordless</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="article-body">
					<h4>Foreword</h4>
					<p>This guide is shaped by direct experience designing, building, deploying, and supporting passwordless authentication across a wide range of organizations. Over the years, I’ve worked on thousands of deployments, spanning hundreds of thousands of companies, from small technology-first teams to large global enterprises with deeply heterogeneous environments.</p>
					<p>In that time, I’ve seen passwordless initiatives succeed, stall, and quietly fail. I’ve seen organizations underestimate the complexity of their own identity ecosystems, overestimate what a single technology can solve, and struggle with the operational realities that emerge only after deployment. I’ve also seen what works—what scales, what meaningfully reduces risk, and what survives contact with real users, real applications, and real attackers.</p>
					<p>This article is not a vendor comparison, a technology deep dive, or a marketing perspective. It is a practitioner’s view of what it actually takes to move an enterprise toward passwordless authentication in a way that is realistic, defensible, and durable. The focus is on architecture, trade-offs, and operational patterns—not idealized end states.</p>
					<p>Passwordless is often presented as a destination. In practice, it is a discipline. The goal of this guide is to help organizations approach that discipline with clearer expectations, better design decisions, and fewer hard lessons learned the long way.</p>

					<h2>Why Passwordless Matters—and Why It’s Harder Than It Looks</h2>
					<p>Most organizations pursuing passwordless authentication are doing so for the right reason: compromised credentials remain the dominant initial access vector for successful attacks. Phishing, credential stuffing, password reuse, and malware designed to harvest secrets continue to work because traditional credentials are long-lived, reusable, and easily exfiltrated. As long as passwords remain central to authentication workflows, attackers can scale their efforts cheaply and reliably.</p>
					<p>Passwordless authentication promises to break this model by removing the credential itself from the attack surface. Instead of something a user knows, access is granted based on possession, biometrics, or cryptographic proof tied to a device. Conceptually, this is a powerful shift. In practice, however, enterprises quickly discover that passwordless is far more complex than replacing a login screen.</p>
					<p>Large organizations are rarely homogeneous. They operate across decades of technology decisions, vendor ecosystems, and operational constraints. Identity is embedded not only in applications, but in infrastructure, automation, third-party integrations, and emergency access paths. Treating passwordless as a feature deployment rather than an architectural change almost guarantees delay, cost overruns, and partial success at best.</p>
					<p>This guide is written from direct experience designing, deploying, and supporting passwordless initiatives in real enterprise environments. Its goal is not to sell a specific technology, but to provide a framework for thinking about passwordless in a way that is realistic, scalable, and grounded in how attackers actually operate.</p>

					<h2>What “Passwordless” Really Means in an Enterprise Context</h2>
					<p>One of the most common sources of confusion in passwordless initiatives is the lack of a shared definition. Different stakeholders use the same term to describe very different outcomes, which leads to misaligned expectations and architectural blind spots.</p>
					<p>In many enterprise conversations, passwordless simply means that users no longer type a password when logging in. This is often achieved through strong multi-factor authentication, device-based credentials, or biometric authenticators enforced by an identity provider. While this is an important improvement, it does not imply that passwords no longer exist within the environment.</p>
					<p>In reality, nearly all enterprise systems still create credentials at some level. User objects in directories have passwords, even if those passwords are never used interactively. Applications still rely on secrets to authenticate to databases, APIs, or external services. Infrastructure systems often depend on local accounts, SSH keys, or shared administrative credentials. These realities do not invalidate passwordless strategies, but they do require a more precise understanding of what success looks like.</p>
					<p>A more useful way to think about passwordless is as a spectrum of maturity. On one end are environments where passwords are ubiquitous, static, and frequently reused. On the other end are environments where human users never handle passwords directly, credentials are short-lived or tightly controlled, and access is mediated through strong cryptographic proof. Most large enterprises will land somewhere in between.</p>
					<p>The critical question is not whether passwords exist, but whether they remain a viable attack vector.</p>

					<h2>The Real Problem: Credential Exposure, Not Passwords Themselves</h2>
					<p>Attackers do not target passwords because they are conceptually weak; they target them because they are reusable and transferable. A stolen password can be replayed from anywhere, often without detection, and frequently grants access to multiple systems.</p>
					<p>Many passwordless initiatives fail to meaningfully reduce this risk because they focus exclusively on the login experience while leaving other credential pathways untouched. It is common to see organizations deploy passwordless authentication for users while continuing to rely on static secrets for administrative access, automation, or legacy systems. From an attacker’s perspective, these environments remain highly attractive.</p>
					<p>A more effective strategy focuses on minimizing credential exposure by design. This involves reducing the number of places where credentials exist, limiting their lifetime, and ensuring that access to them is gated by strong, passwordless authentication. When passwords are required, they should be treated as sensitive operational artifacts rather than identity factors.</p>
					<p>This shift in mindset is foundational. Without it, passwordless becomes cosmetic rather than transformative.</p>

					<h2>Why Enterprise Passwordless Deployments Fail</h2>
					<p>Most failures stem from predictable patterns that repeat across organizations.</p>
					<p>One common issue is an overemphasis on authentication methods. Teams spend significant time evaluating hardware keys, platform authenticators, or biometric solutions, often assuming that choosing the “right” factor will determine success. While these decisions matter, they do little to address downstream systems that still require passwords or secrets.</p>
					<p>Another frequent problem is underestimating application sprawl. Enterprises often discover, mid-project, that a significant portion of their applications cannot integrate with modern identity protocols. These systems may be mission-critical, vendor-controlled, or deeply embedded in business processes. Without a plan for these applications, passwordless initiatives stall or fragment.</p>
					<p>Infrastructure access is also routinely overlooked. Servers, network devices, and cloud management consoles often represent the highest-risk targets, yet they are rarely addressed in early passwordless planning. Attackers understand this asymmetry and exploit it.</p>
					<p>Finally, many organizations treat passwordless as a deployment rather than an operating model. They focus on initial rollout but fail to establish long-term ownership for enrollment, recovery, exception handling, and continuous integration of new systems. Over time, operational shortcuts reintroduce passwords, undermining the original intent.</p>

					<h2>Start With Reality: Application and Resource Rationalization</h2>
					<p>A successful passwordless strategy begins with an honest assessment of the environment. This typically requires a structured rationalization effort that goes beyond application inventories maintained for licensing or asset management.</p>
					<p>Organizations need to understand not only what systems exist, but how access is granted, how credentials are stored, and who relies on them. Applications should be evaluated based on their ability to integrate with centralized identity systems, the sensitivity of the data they expose, and the populations that use them.</p>
					<p>This process often reveals that a small subset of applications accounts for a disproportionate amount of user access and risk. These systems are natural starting points for passwordless enforcement. Conversely, it also surfaces long-tail applications that may require alternative approaches, such as credential abstraction or controlled exceptions.</p>
					<p>Rationalization is not a one-time exercise. As environments evolve, new systems are introduced, and old ones linger longer than expected, maintaining this visibility becomes a core part of the identity program.</p>

					<h2>Identity Providers as the Control Plane</h2>
					<p>Identity providers play a central role in any passwordless architecture because they provide a consistent enforcement point for authentication policies. By concentrating authentication decisions in a single system, organizations gain visibility, control, and the ability to deploy phishing-resistant authentication at scale.</p>
					<p>However, identity providers are not a panacea. They only protect resources that integrate with them, and they do not eliminate the need for credentials elsewhere in the environment. Treating the identity provider as a universal solution often leads to frustration when integration limitations surface.</p>
					<p>A more productive approach is to view the identity provider as the control plane for human authentication. It defines how users prove who they are, but not necessarily how every system consumes that proof. This distinction opens the door to architectural patterns that extend passwordless benefits beyond direct federation.</p>

					<h2>Addressing Applications That Do Not Support Federation</h2>
					<p>Legacy and non-federated applications are where many passwordless initiatives lose momentum. These systems are common, varied, and often critical to business operations.</p>
					<p>The most straightforward solution is vendor modernization: working with suppliers to add support for modern federation protocols. While desirable, this approach is frequently slow and outside the organization’s direct control.</p>
					<p>Authentication orchestration and middleware offer an alternative by decoupling authentication from the application itself. In this model, users authenticate to the identity provider using passwordless methods, and an intermediary translates that authentication into whatever mechanism the application requires. This can significantly reduce risk without modifying the application, though it introduces additional infrastructure and operational considerations.</p>
					<p>In cases where neither direct integration nor middleware is feasible, password abstraction becomes a practical compromise. Credential vaults allow passwords to be rotated, stored securely, and accessed only through controlled workflows. Users never see the password, and access is granted only after passwordless authentication. While not truly passwordless, this approach removes passwords from the user experience and dramatically reduces their exposure.</p>

					<h2>Infrastructure, Privileged Access, and High-Value Targets</h2>
					<p>Infrastructure access represents one of the most challenging areas for passwordless adoption, yet it is also one of the most important. Administrative credentials often grant broad access, persist for long periods, and are poorly monitored.</p>
					<p>A realistic passwordless strategy for infrastructure does not eliminate credentials outright. Instead, it focuses on brokering access through systems that enforce strong authentication and provide auditability. Privileged access management platforms, combined with passwordless authentication at the front door, allow organizations to control who can access sensitive systems, for how long, and under what conditions.</p>
					<p>This model aligns closely with attacker behavior. By concentrating defensive effort where the value is highest, organizations can achieve meaningful risk reduction even if some credentials remain in use behind the scenes.</p>

					<h2>Enrollment, Recovery, and Device Trust</h2>
					<p>Operational realities often determine whether passwordless systems succeed or fail. Enrollment must be straightforward, secure, and scalable. Recovery processes must be well-defined and tested, particularly for scenarios involving lost devices or personnel changes.</p>
					<p>Device trust adds another layer of complexity. Passwordless authentication often relies on the assumption that a device is trustworthy, yet enterprises support a wide range of platforms, operating systems, and access patterns. Designing policies that balance security with usability requires careful planning and ongoing adjustment.</p>
					<p>When recovery paths are unclear or unreliable, users and administrators find workarounds. These workarounds almost always involve passwords.</p>

					<h2>A Phased Approach to Passwordless Adoption</h2>
					<p>Given these complexities, most organizations benefit from a phased approach rather than attempting to “go passwordless” everywhere at once.</p>
					<p>Early phases typically focus on workforce authentication through the identity provider, followed by integration of high-impact applications. Subsequent phases address legacy systems through middleware or credential abstraction, and later extend to infrastructure and non-human identities.</p>
					<p>Throughout this process, progress should be measured in terms of reduced credential exposure and improved control, not the absolute number of passwords eliminated.</p>

					<h2>Designing for the Inevitable: Passwords Will Still Exist</h2>
					<p>Even in mature environments, passwords and secrets do not disappear entirely. Directories still generate credentials, and certain workflows still depend on them. The difference lies in how these credentials are managed.</p>
					<p>Automated rotation, policy-driven generation, and temporary checkout mechanisms ensure that passwords are short-lived and tightly controlled. Access to them is mediated through passwordless authentication, and their use is auditable and constrained.</p>
					<p>In this model, passwords are no longer a primary means of authentication. They become controlled implementation details, insulated from users and attackers alike.</p>

					<h2>What Success Actually Looks Like</h2>
					<p>Truly passwordless enterprises are rare, but resilient identity architectures are achievable. Success is not defined by the absence of passwords, but by the absence of exploitable credentials.</p>
					<p>In a successful passwordless program, users authenticate without passwords, credentials are ephemeral and controlled, and attackers cannot easily reuse stolen secrets. Achieving this state requires realistic expectations, architectural discipline, and ongoing operational commitment.</p>
					<p>Passwordless is not a destination. It is a way of designing identity systems that acknowledge enterprise complexity while materially reducing one of the most persistent sources of risk.</p>
