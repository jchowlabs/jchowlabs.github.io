					<h1>The Enterprise Guide to Going Passwordless</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="article-body">
					<h4>Foreword</h4>
                    <br>
					<p>This guide is shaped by my experience designing, building, deploying, and supporting a wide range of organizations along their passwordless journey. Over the years, I’ve worked on thousands of deployments, spanning small, technology-first organizations, to large global enterprises with heterogeneous ecosystems that depend on modern and legacy infrastructure.</p>
					<p>In that time, I’ve seen many passwordless initiatives succeed, stall, and quietly fail. I’ve seen organizations underestimate the complexity of their identity environments, overestimate what a single technology can solve, and struggle with the operational realities that only emerge during and after deployment. I’ve also seen what works, what scales, what meaningfully reduces risk, and what holds up against real users, real applications, and real attackers.</p>
					<p>This is not a vendor comparison, a technology deep dive, or a marketing perspective. It is a practitioner’s guide to how enterprise passwordless initiatives take shape in the real world, why some succeed, why others stall, and where some outright fail. The focus is on architecture, trade-offs, and deployment patterns rather than idealized end states.</p>
					<p>The goal of this guide is to help organizations, whether they are just beginning the journey, actively deploying, or struggling with an existing implementation, approach passwordless in a way that is practical, durable, and grounded in real-world experience.</p>

					<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
					<p>Organizations pursue passwordless authentication because compromised credentials remain the most common initial access vector for successful attacks. Modern technologies such as WebAuthn and FIDO make it possible to remove passwords from many authentication flows while improving usability. The technology exists, and the problem is well understood.</p>
					<p>The challenge is the environment. Enterprises operate across hundreds of applications, thousands of devices, and deeply embedded legacy and infrastructure systems. Credentials continue to exist in many forms, and attackers exploit the weakest access paths rather than the most modern ones.</p>
					<p>In an enterprise context, passwordless does not mean eliminating credentials entirely. It means reducing everyday credential exposure by removing human-managed passwords from routine access. Machine credentials, infrastructure access, and service identities represent a different class of risk and require different controls.</p>
					<p>Many passwordless initiatives fail because they stop at login screens, underestimate application sprawl, overlook privileged access, or treat passwordless as a one-time deployment rather than an operating model. Others fail operationally when enrollment, recovery, or device trust processes are weak and easily exploited.</p>
					<p>Successful passwordless programs start by understanding where authentication actually happens, centralizing authentication decisions through an identity provider, addressing non-federated systems pragmatically, and focusing defensive effort on high-value infrastructure access. Adoption should be phased, with progress measured by reduced credential exposure and increased attacker friction, not by the absolute number of passwords eliminated.</p>
					<p>Passwordless is not a destination. Success is achieved when users no longer handle reusable secrets, credentials that must exist are tightly controlled, and identity becomes a centralized control plane rather than a collection of scattered passwords.</p>


					<h2>Why Go Passwordless and Why It Is Harder Than It Looks</h2>
					<p>It is well understood why organizations prioritize passwordless initiatives. For nearly two decades, the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report has consistently shown that weak, stolen, or compromised credentials are among the most common attack vectors responsible for some of the largest and most damaging breaches.</p>
					<p>From that perspective, removing passwords from the authentication flow is an obvious solution. Fortunately, modern technologies such as WebAuthn and FIDO-based authentication make it practical to remove the password while also improving the end-user experience. At a high level, these standards use strong cryptographic digital signatures combined with local biometric verification on the user’s device as the method of authentication. This is one of the rare cases where strengthening security aligns naturally with better usability.</p>
					<p>The challenge, then, is not a lack of understanding of the problem itself, nor the availability of a solution. The challenge comes from the environment.</p>
					<p>Enterprise environments are rarely clean or homogeneous. They reflect years, and often decades, of accumulated technology decisions. Identity is embedded across SaaS platforms, custom applications, legacy systems, infrastructure, third-party services, and operational access paths. Many of these systems were never designed to support modern authentication standards, let alone passwordless ones.</p>
					<p>From that perspective, removing passwords from the authentication flow is an obvious solution. Fortunately, modern technologies such as WebAuthn and FIDO-based authentication make it practical to remove the password while also improving the end-user experience. At a high level, these standards use strong cryptographic digital signatures combined with local biometric verification on the user’s device as the method of authentication. This is one of the rare cases where strengthening security aligns naturally with better usability.</p>
					<p>As a result, organizations often discover that going passwordless is not a matter of replacing a login screen. It requires rethinking how authentication is brokered, where credentials still exist, and how access is granted across a fragmented and interdependent environment. Initiatives fail not because the goal is wrong, but because the complexity of the environment and the operational impact of change are underestimated.</p>

					<div class="callout">
						<div class="callout-title">Practitioner Note</div>
						<p>Successful passwordless initiatives begin by understanding where credentials exist today and how they are exposed across applications, infrastructure, and operations.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>What Passwordless Really Means in an Enterprise</h2>
					<p>In enterprise contexts, passwordless is best understood as an effort to reduce credential exposure, not to eliminate credentials entirely. The primary goal is to remove the most common and most abused attack vector: weak, stolen, or misused credentials that humans use every day to access systems, applications, and infrastructure.</p>
					<p>This distinction matters. Even in mature environments, credentials continue to exist in many forms. User objects in directories still have passwords, even if they are rarely used. Infrastructure relies on SSH keys, certificates, and local accounts. Applications and services authenticate using API tokens, OAuth credentials, and shared secrets. These credentials do not disappear simply because users no longer type passwords into login prompts.</p>
					<p>When organizations talk about going passwordless, they are almost always referring to end-user authentication. The intent is to eliminate the routine use of human-managed secrets for day-to-day access. This materially reduces risk because humans consistently represent the largest source of credential exposure. Password reuse, phishing susceptibility, and poor secret hygiene are structural problems, not training failures.</p>
					<p>Machine credentials and non-human identities are also important, but they represent a different class of problem. These credentials are typically used less frequently, are scoped more narrowly, and are often protected by additional controls such as vaulting, rotation, checkout workflows, and privileged access management systems. While far from perfect, these controls reduce exposure in ways that are not yet consistently available for human authentication at scale.</p>
					<p>Passwordless authentication also extends beyond web login experiences. Smart cards, certificates, and device-based authenticators have long been used in enterprise environments to reduce reliance on passwords. Modern passwordless approaches build on these patterns by making cryptographic authentication easier to deploy, easier to recover from, and more consistent across platforms.</p>
					<p>It is neither realistic nor necessary to eliminate every form of credential to achieve meaningful security gains. What matters is reducing the everyday exposure created by humans using passwords to access the systems they rely on to do their work. That is the problem passwordless is designed to solve.</p>

					<div class="callout">
						<div class="callout-title">Design Principle</div>
						<p>Passwordless strategies focus on reducing high-frequency, human-managed credential exposure. Machine credentials require different controls, not denial.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Why Credential Exposure Remains the Real Problem</h2>
					<p>Passwords are often framed as the root cause of credential-based attacks. In practice, the problem is broader and more precise. Attackers do not succeed simply because passwords exist. They succeed because reusable credentials are exposed, stolen, and replayed across environments.</p>
					<p>This distinction matters because many passwordless initiatives stop at the login screen. Organizations successfully eliminate passwords from workforce authentication, but leave other credential pathways largely unchanged. Administrative access, automation, legacy applications, and infrastructure often continue to rely on static secrets that persist for long periods and are valid across multiple systems. From an attacker’s perspective, these environments remain highly exploitable.</p>
					<p>Credential exposure is not limited to passwords entered by users. It includes any reusable secret that can be captured and replayed, whether through phishing, malware, misconfiguration, or lateral movement. When credentials are long-lived, broadly scoped, and insufficiently monitored, attackers can bypass hardened authentication flows entirely and target weaker access paths.</p>
					<p>The weakness is not the credential itself. It is the combination of a reusable secret and a human or system that can be tricked, compromised, or misused. Humans are particularly poor at protecting secrets at scale, especially when those secrets are used frequently and across many systems. Attackers exploit this mismatch relentlessly.</p>
					<p>Effective passwordless strategies recognize this reality and treat credentials as sensitive artifacts rather than identity factors. The objective is not to eliminate every credential, but to reduce where credentials exist, limit how long they remain valid, constrain where they can be used, and ensure access to them is gated by strong authentication and authorization controls wherever possible.</p>
					<p>This is the lens through which passwordless success should be measured. If credential exposure remains high, risk remains high, regardless of how users authenticate at login.</p>

					<div class="callout">
						<div class="callout-title">Practitioner Note</div>
						<p>Removing passwords from login screens without addressing how credentials are issued, stored, and accessed elsewhere does not reduce risk. It shifts the attack surface.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Why Enterprise Passwordless Deployments Fail</h2>
					<p>Enterprise passwordless initiatives rarely fail because the underlying authentication technology is immature. They fail because the scope of the problem is misunderstood, or because early design decisions do not account for how identity actually functions across the environment.</p>
					<p>One common failure mode is over-indexing on authentication factors. Teams spend significant time evaluating hardware keys, platform authenticators, biometric options, or passkeys, often assuming that selecting the “right” factor will determine the success of the initiative. While these decisions matter, they do little to address the systems that still require passwords or secrets after authentication is complete.</p>
					<p>Another frequent issue is underestimating application sprawl. Enterprises often discover partway through a deployment that a substantial portion of their applications cannot integrate with modern identity protocols such as SAML or OpenID Connect. These systems may be mission-critical, vendor-controlled, or deeply embedded in business processes. Without a clear strategy for handling these applications, passwordless initiatives fragment into partial deployments with inconsistent security outcomes.</p>
					<p>Infrastructure access is also routinely overlooked. Servers, network devices, and cloud management consoles often represent the highest-value targets in an environment, yet they are rarely addressed early in passwordless planning. Attackers understand this asymmetry and exploit it, bypassing hardened user login flows in favor of weaker operational access paths.</p>
					<p>Finally, many organizations treat passwordless as a deployment rather than an operating model. Initial rollouts receive attention and investment, but long-term ownership is unclear. Enrollment, recovery, exception handling, and onboarding of new systems are handled informally. Over time, operational shortcuts reintroduce passwords and shared credentials, quietly eroding the original security gains.</p>

					<div class="callout">
						<div class="callout-title">Practitioner Note</div>
						<p>Most passwordless initiatives do not fail loudly. They degrade slowly as exceptions accumulate and ownership diffuses.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Start With Reality: Understand What You Have</h2>
					<p>A successful passwordless strategy begins with an honest and comprehensive assessment of the environment. This requires more than a traditional application inventory maintained for licensing or asset management purposes. The goal is not simply to know what exists, but to understand how access actually works across the organization.</p>
					<p>Organizations need to understand what users authenticate to, how authentication is performed, and where credentials exist today. In most enterprises, this includes hundreds of applications, thousands of user devices, and even more infrastructure and operational resources. Each of these represents a potential authentication surface and, therefore, a potential source of credential exposure.</p>
					<p>Applications and resources should be evaluated across several dimensions. These typically include their ability to integrate with centralized identity systems, the sensitivity of the access they provide, the populations that rely on them, and the types of credentials they use today. This analysis often reveals that a relatively small number of systems account for the majority of user access and risk, while a long tail of applications introduces complexity that is disproportionate to their business value.</p>
					<p>This is where rationalization becomes essential. Rationalization is not about achieving perfect coverage or eliminating every outlier. It is about sequencing. Without it, organizations attempt to treat all systems as equally important, expand scope too quickly, and stall under the weight of their own environment before meaningful progress is made.</p>
					<p>A practical outcome of this exercise is categorization. Some systems are strong candidates for passwordless authentication through centralized identity providers. Others may require intermediary controls, credential abstraction, or vaulting because they cannot be modernized quickly or safely. Understanding these categories early allows organizations to move forward deliberately rather than reactively.</p>

					<div class="callout">
						<div class="callout-title">Design Principle</div>
						<p>You cannot design a passwordless strategy until you understand where authentication actually happens and how credentials are used.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Identity Providers as the Control Plane</h2>
					<p>Centralizing authentication through an identity provider is foundational to any scalable passwordless strategy. Identity providers allow organizations to enforce consistent authentication policies, deploy phishing-resistant authentication methods, and gain visibility into how users access resources across the environment.</p>
					<p>However, identity providers are not universal adapters. They only protect systems that can integrate with them, and they do not eliminate the need for credentials elsewhere in the environment. Treating the identity provider as a complete solution often leads to frustration when integration limitations emerge and legacy systems fail to conform.</p>
					<p>A more effective mental model is to treat the identity provider as the control plane for human authentication. It defines how users prove their identity, which authentication methods are permitted, and under what conditions access is granted. How that proof is consumed by downstream systems may vary, and in many cases requires additional architectural components to bridge gaps in capability.</p>
					<p>Recognizing this distinction early is critical. It allows organizations to plan realistically, sequence integrations intentionally, and avoid overpromising outcomes that the environment cannot support. Identity providers create consistency at the point of authentication, but they are only one part of a broader access architecture.</p>

					<div class="callout">
						<div class="callout-title">Practitioner Note</div>
						<p>Identity providers centralize authentication decisions. They do not automatically modernize every system that depends on them.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Addressing Applications That Do Not Support Federation</h2>
					<p>Applications that do not support modern federation protocols are where many passwordless initiatives lose momentum. These systems are common, varied, and often critical to business operations. They frequently include legacy applications, vendor-managed platforms, or internally developed systems that predate modern identity standards.</p>
					<p>Once authentication is centralized through an identity provider, these applications become the primary source of friction. They cannot consume modern authentication assertions directly, yet they remain essential to how the organization operates. Ignoring them or deferring them indefinitely undermines the effectiveness of any passwordless strategy.</p>
					<p>There are three practical approaches organizations typically take to address this challenge.</p>
					<p>The most straightforward option is vendor modernization. Encouraging or requiring vendors to support standards such as SAML or OpenID Connect is the cleanest long-term solution. When successful, this allows applications to integrate directly with centralized identity systems and inherit passwordless authentication policies. In practice, however, this approach is often slow, dependent on vendor roadmaps, and outside the organization’s immediate control.</p>
					<p>Authentication orchestration and middleware provide an alternative. In this model, users authenticate to the identity provider using passwordless methods, and an intermediary layer translates that authentication into whatever mechanism the application requires. This allows organizations to enforce strong authentication without modifying the application itself, at the cost of additional infrastructure and operational complexity. For many enterprises, this approach becomes a critical bridge between modern identity systems and legacy applications.</p>
					<p>In situations where neither direct integration nor middleware is feasible, password abstraction becomes a practical compromise. Credential vaults allow passwords to be rotated, stored securely, and accessed only through controlled workflows. Users never see the password, and access is granted only after passwordless authentication. While this does not eliminate passwords entirely, it removes them from the user experience and significantly reduces their exposure.</p>
					<p>In practice, most enterprises use a combination of all three approaches, depending on application risk, lifecycle stage, and ownership. Treating these options as complementary rather than mutually exclusive enables progress without waiting for perfect conditions.</p>

					<div class="callout">
						<div class="callout-title">Design Principle</div>
						<p>Modernizing authentication does not always require modernizing the application.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Infrastructure, Privileged Access, and High-Value Targets</h2>
					<p>Infrastructure and privileged access represent some of the most challenging and highest-impact areas for passwordless adoption. Administrative credentials often provide broad access, persist for long periods, and are poorly monitored relative to the level of risk they introduce. When abused, they enable lateral movement, persistence, and large-scale damage.</p>
					<p>A realistic passwordless strategy for infrastructure does not attempt to eliminate credentials outright. Instead, it focuses on brokering access through systems that enforce strong authentication, limit session duration, and provide auditability. Privileged access management platforms, when combined with passwordless authentication at the point of entry, allow organizations to tightly control who can access sensitive systems, under what conditions, and for how long.</p>
					<p>This model closely aligns with attacker behavior. Attackers rarely target hardened workforce login flows directly once initial access is obtained. Instead, they seek out weaker infrastructure credentials that grant elevated privileges and broad visibility into the environment. By concentrating defensive effort where the value is highest, organizations can materially reduce risk even when some credentials must remain in use behind the scenes.</p>
					<p>The goal is not to make infrastructure passwordless in the same way as workforce authentication. The goal is to reduce exposure, narrow blast radius, and ensure that access to high-value targets is gated by strong authentication, contextual controls, and continuous monitoring.</p>

					<div class="callout">
						<div class="callout-title">Practitioner Note</div>
						<p>If a passwordless initiative stops at workforce login, it stops short of where attackers usually go.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>Onboarding, Account Recovery, and Device Trust</h2>
					<p>Operational realities often determine whether passwordless systems succeed or fail. Strong authentication alone is not sufficient if the processes used to enroll users, recover access, or establish device trust are weak or poorly designed. In many real-world incidents, attackers do not break authentication mechanisms; they exploit enrollment and recovery flows that allow them to assume another user’s identity.</p>
					<p>Enrollment must be secure, but it must also be practical at scale. Recovery paths must be clearly defined, well-tested, and resilient under real conditions, not just ideal ones. Lost devices, hardware failures, employee turnover, and emergency access scenarios are inevitable. When recovery processes are fragile, overly permissive, or poorly governed, they become an attractive target for attackers seeking to bypass otherwise strong authentication controls.</p>
					<p>This risk does not disappear in a passwordless architecture. In fact, as authentication mechanisms become stronger, enrollment and recovery flows often become the weakest link. Attackers increasingly target identity proofing, account recovery, and exception handling processes as a way to gain access without needing to compromise a password or authentication factor directly.</p>
					<p>Device trust adds another layer of complexity. Passwordless authentication often assumes a trusted device, but enterprise environments support a wide range of operating systems, device types, and access contexts. Policies that are too rigid create friction and exceptions, while policies that are too permissive erode the value of device-based authentication. These decisions must be revisited continuously as the environment evolves.</p>
					<p>Organizations that treat enrollment, recovery, and device trust as secondary concerns often discover that these operational gaps, not cryptographic weaknesses, are what ultimately undermine their passwordless strategy. Designing these flows deliberately is essential to sustaining strong authentication over time.</p>

					<div class="callout">
						<div class="callout-title">Design Principle</div>
						<p>Strong authentication can be bypassed through weak enrollment and recovery processes.</p>
					</div>

					<h2>A Phased Approach to Passwordless Adoption</h2>
					<p>Given the scope and complexity involved, most organizations benefit from a phased approach to passwordless adoption rather than attempting comprehensive coverage from the outset. Trying to address every application, system, and access path at once often leads to stalled initiatives, inconsistent experiences, and increased operational risk.</p>
					<p>Early phases typically focus on enforcing passwordless authentication through the identity provider for high-impact, user-facing applications. These are the systems most frequently accessed by users and, therefore, the largest source of everyday credential exposure. Concentrating initial efforts here allows organizations to reduce risk quickly while validating user experience, enrollment, and recovery processes at scale.</p>
					<p>Subsequent phases address systems that cannot integrate directly with centralized identity platforms. This often includes legacy applications, custom systems, and operational tools that require orchestration, middleware, or credential abstraction. Progress in these phases is less about speed and more about consistency, ensuring that authentication behavior remains predictable even when underlying systems differ.</p>
					<p>Later phases extend passwordless principles to infrastructure access and non-human identities. While these areas involve fewer users, they represent significantly higher risk. Brokering access, limiting session duration, and enforcing strong authentication at entry points can materially reduce blast radius even when credentials must remain in use behind the scenes.</p>
					<p>Throughout each phase, progress should be measured in terms of reduced credential exposure, improved control, and increased attacker friction, not by the absolute number of passwords eliminated. Passwordless maturity is reflected in how rarely humans handle reusable secrets and how constrained those secrets are when they must exist.</p>
					<p>Phasing also allows organizations to learn and adjust. Authentication changes affect productivity, support processes, and operational workflows. A deliberate rollout creates space to test assumptions, refine policies, and correct course before expanding scope.</p>

					<h2>Designing for the Inevitable: Passwords Will Still Exist</h2>
					<p>Even in mature environments, passwords never fully disappear. This is an important reality to acknowledge early, because many passwordless initiatives struggle precisely because they are designed around the assumption that credentials can be eliminated entirely.</p>
					<p>In most directory services, the creation of a user account still involves the creation of a credential. That credential may rarely be used, or never used at all for interactive login, but it exists. The same is true for service accounts, administrative identities, and many system-level access paths. Passwordless authentication changes how users authenticate. It does not eliminate the need for credentials across the environment.</p>
					<p>Beyond directories, modern enterprise environments rely on a wide range of non-password credentials. Infrastructure access often depends on SSH keys or certificates. Applications and services authenticate using API tokens, OAuth credentials, or shared secrets. Network devices and operational systems frequently rely on local accounts that cannot be federated. These mechanisms are not inherently insecure, but they represent credentials that must be managed deliberately.</p>
					<p>The distinction is not whether credentials exist, but how they are handled.</p>
					<p>In resilient passwordless architectures, credentials are treated as controlled artifacts rather than authentication factors. Passwords and secrets are generated automatically, rotated frequently, and stored securely. Access to them is tightly governed and typically mediated by strong, passwordless authentication. When credentials are required, they are short-lived, auditable, and scoped as narrowly as possible.</p>
					<p>This approach accepts the reality of enterprise systems while materially reducing exposure. Passwords are no longer something users know or manage. They become implementation details that are intentionally isolated from both users and attackers.</p>

						<p>You do not eliminate credentials by pretending they are unnecessary. You reduce risk by controlling how and where they exist.</p>

					<h2>What Success Actually Looks Like</h2>
					<p>Truly passwordless environments are rare. After thousands of passwordless deployments across organizations of all sizes, I have never personally seen an environment where credentials were eliminated entirely. That is not a limitation of passwordless approaches. It is a reflection of how modern systems actually function.</p>
					<p>The mistake many organizations make is treating the complete removal of credentials as the success metric. That goal is neither realistic nor necessary. Credentials will always exist somewhere in the environment, whether in directories, infrastructure, services, or automation workflows. Attempting to eliminate every credential often leads to fragile designs and operational shortcuts that increase risk rather than reduce it.</p>
					<p>The real measure of success is the reduction of everyday credential exposure. When users no longer know or handle passwords, when reusable secrets are removed from routine access paths, and when credentials that must exist are tightly governed and accessed only through strong authentication, the attack surface changes materially.</p>
					<p>In successful passwordless programs, credentials lose their value to attackers. Stolen secrets cannot be easily replayed. Privileged access is brokered rather than assumed. Lateral movement becomes more difficult and more visible. Identity shifts from a collection of scattered credentials to a centralized control plane.</p>
					<p>This is what success looks like in practice. Not the elimination of every credential, but the elimination of credential exposure as a reliable attack vector. Passwordless is not a destination. It is an approach to identity design that prioritizes risk reduction over ideological purity.</p>

						<p>If your goal is to remove every credential, you will fail. If your goal is to remove the routine exposure of credentials, you are designing for how real systems and real attackers operate.</p>
