                            <p class="featured-subtitle">FIDO (Fast Identity Online) is among the latest standards security practitioners rely on to fortify their systems against phishing attacks and credential theft. Renowned for its use of strong cryptographic primitives and robust phishing resistance, FIDO has been broadly adopted to secure access to critical systems and resources. However, a new bypass technique—known as Browser-in-the-Middle (BiTM)—has emerged, presenting a theoretical method to circumvent even FIDO-protected environments. This article explores the mechanics of the BiTM attack and its implications for the future of authentication security.</p>
